xmlfs - mount xml files to file systems

xmlfs is an userspace application that lets you mount an xml file in the directory structure. xmlfs uses FUSE for the file system bindings and the Gnome project libxml2.

XML nodes are represented as directories with an index prepended to handle duplicates.
Attribute become files containing the attribute value.
Node content is available in the #text files.

Note that xmlfs is at a very early version. Currently handles simple XML, ASCII and read-only file structure. 

Depends on: FUSE (http://fuse.sourceforge.net/) and libxml2 (http://www.xmlsoft.org/).
