xmlfs - mount an xml file to a file system

Nodes become directories with an index prepended to handle duplicates.
Attribute become files with value in it.
Node content is available in the #text files.

Very early version. Currently handles simple XML, ASCII and read-only file structure. 
More documentation will come.

Depends on: FUSE (http://fuse.sourceforge.net/) and libxml2 (http://www.xmlsoft.org/).
